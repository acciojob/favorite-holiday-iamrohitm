	<h1>New York</h1>
	<p>New York is a U.S. state in the northeastern region of the country, best known for New York City, one of the world’s major cultural, financial, and media centers. The state is geographically diverse, ranging from the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains to fertile farmland, large lakes, and Atlantic coastline.
	New York City—made up of five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island)—is famous for landmarks like Times Square, Central Park, Wall Street, and Broadway. Beyond the city, upstate New York includes historic towns, Niagara Falls, major universities, and important manufacturing and agricultural areas.
	New York is the fourth most populous state in the U.S. and has a major influence on finance, arts, fashion, immigration, and politics. It is known for its cultural diversity, fast-paced urban life, and significant role in American history and the global economy.
